## Project Title : Automated Animal Identification and Detection of Species (AAIDeS)

Marine fishery is very dynamic in nature. During active season landing of fish may be overwhalming for a manual monitoring. At the same time, taking que of the fish landing is important for researchers and administrators. Manual reporting is limited with sample size, often too small, that lead to high level of errors and prone to wrong extrapolation for meaningful fish stock assessment. This calls for automation to be only feasible method to overcome limitations of manual monitoring and reporting.

The manual mode may rather be used to better train computer algorithms. A solution should focus on image recognition for species made available in the database. Over the time the database may get richer and thus, making the machine learning better. Such a system should envision cameras installed at the harbours and weigh-bridges, where species may be identified by AI and their propotion (in mixed catch) can be estimated, in order to report the captured biomass effectively and with minimal manual intervention. At present, the catch effort is often the weakest link in stock assessment model. Such harbor based systems may reduce the errors significantly. Another use is to integrate the cloud-based algorithms to help report catch through app(s) where all a fisherman need to do is to click the photo of the catch and enter the estimated catch weight.
